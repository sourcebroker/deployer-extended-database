Changelog
---------

20.1.0
------

1) [FEATURE] Add dbCodeFilter option to filter database (credits to `SimonVanacco <https://github.com/SimonVanacco>`_ )
2) [BUGFIX] SSL options in drop tables command (credits to `maikschneider <https://github.com/maikschneider>`_ )
3) [BUGFIX] Make strict boolean conditions for ``post_sql_in_markers`` and ``post_sql_in``.
4) [BUGFIX] Fix the logic for resolving PHP binary. If the binary specified by ``php_version`` or ``composer.json``
   is not found, it now gracefully falls back to search for ``php`` binary and finally defaults to plain ``php``.

20.0.1
------

1) [BUGFIX] Fix the way the ``local/bin/php`` is determined.

20.0.0
------

1) [TASK][BREAKING] Use new version of ``sourcebroker/deployer-instance``. This version has fallback when no .env (or .env.local)
   file exists. It will take the system variables then. This should not break anything, but anyway a major version just to be sure.

19.0.0
------

1) [BUGFIX] Fix wrong use of ``bin/php`` for local context. Deployer ``bin/php``, when not a explicitly set as string,
   is using ``which()`` function, that is using ``run()`` in background, which is trying to make connection to local ssh.
   This fix uses ``local/bin/php`` instead which will check locally: first ``php_version`` setting of host, then if not
   found it will check ``composer.json`` for the php version. If php version is found, then the binary will be searched first
   for X.Y (like 8.4) and then for XY (84). Finally if ``php_version`` or ``composer.json`` do not give answer about
   php version it will fallback just to search ``php`` binary.

2) [BUGFIX] Fix some edge cases for replacing the task names in nested outputs.

3) [BUGFIX] Remove using "stat" command in ``db:download`` and ``db:upload`` commands because not available on some systems. Use ``filesize()``
   from php as command is run locally, use ``glob()`` instead of ``ls`` as for the same reason. Fix the files size calculation.

4) [FEATURE] Add options to disable task infos: ``db_download_info_enable``, ``db_upload_info_enable``,
   ``db_import_big_table_info_enable``, ``db_pull_from_local_storage_info_enable``. By default, they all are enabled.

5) [BUGFIX][BREAKING] Fix wrong name of option in db:import task. It was ``db_import_show_ignore_tables_output_max_line_length``
   but should be ``db_import_big_table_output_max_line_length``. Rename option ``db_export_mysqldump_show_ignore_tables_out``
   to ``db_export_mysqldump_show_ignore_tables_out_info_enable`` in db:export. Change default value of
   ``db_export_mysqldump_show_ignore_tables_out_max_line_length`` from 250 to 120.

6) [TASK] Add ``localhost('local')`` by default.

18.2.0
------

1) [TASK] Extend the dependency to v5 of ``sourcebroker/deployer-loader``.

18.1.1
------
1) [BUGFIX] Last line of ignored tables at db:export task was not shown. This change fix this and also make refactor for this part.

18.1.0
------
1) [FEATURE] Allow to add custom options to ``--options=``. If option has prefix ``tx`` is not validated.
   For example ``--options=txMyOption:myValue``.

18.0.3
------

1) [BUGFIX] The constant GLOB_BRACE is not defined on all systems, like fe Alpine Linux. After this fix GLOB_BRACE
   is no longer used.
2) [BUGFIX] Fix the condition for checking if release_path exists. It was failing when ``db:backup`` at localhost was
   invoked because ``release_path`` is not set then. Replace with usage of ``deploy_path`` and hardcoded ``release``.

18.0.2
------

1) [BUGFIX] Fix wrong condition on ``db:backup``. After this fix tags "release" and "release_X" will be automatically added
   when task ``db:backup`` is run during deploy before ``deploy:symlink``.

18.0.1
------

1) [BUGFIX] PHP 7.4 compatibility fixes.

18.0.0
------

1) [TASK][BREAKING] Change the default charset for mysql/mysqldump operations from utf8 to utf8mb4.
2) [TASK] Add output formatting helper functions in ConsoleUtility.
3) [FEATURE] Add way to validate value of single ``--options`` with preg_match in ConsoleUtility->getOption.
4) [TASK][BREAKING] Add preg_match for dumpcode ``/^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/``
5) [TASK] Add support for resolving home in deploy_path
6) [TASK][BREAKING] Remove autocreation of dumpcode on db:export. Since now you need to add your dumpcode
   with --options=dumpcode:mydumpcode
7) [TASK] Move db credentials to temporary file and use it with ``--defaults-file=``. Reason is edge case that ``MYSQL_PWD``
   was overwritten by ``~/.my.cnf`` files. For example: https://github.com/ddev/ddev/pull/6851
8) [FEATURE] Add info about big tables on db:import. Useful to fast check if we import some not needed big tables.
   Default limit is 50MB. You can change it to your value in ``db_import_big_table_size_threshold``.
9) [FEATURE] Add info about ignored tables on mysqldump in db:export. You can configure max_line in
   ``db_export_mysqldump_show_ignore_tables_out_max_line_length``.
10) [TASK][BREAKING] Change bahaviour of ``db:download`` and ``db:upload``. Option ``--remove-source-files`` has been
    removed from rsync and downloaded, uploaded files are not longer automatically removed. Add short info about size
    of downloaded or uploaded file.
11) [TASK] Show ``db:dumpclean`` output only when verbosity higher than regular.
12) [TASK][BREAKING] Change behaviour of ``db:copy``, ``db:pull``, ``db:push``. No longer copy of imported database is
    kept in database storage. This is clean up before implementing a backup of replaced database. Add nice formatting
    of tasks with info about ignored tables, size od downloaded/uploaded database and too big tables.
13) [FEATURE] Add command ``db:import:last`` to import last downloaded database. Bring back keeping last imported databases
    and rotation of those.
14) [FEATURE] Add validation for name of options. If name is wrong task will stop.
15) [TASK][BREAKING] Move normalizeFolder functionality into 'db_storage_path_local' function as it was used only in
    this context. Remove FileUtility->normalizeFolder
16) [TASK][BREAKING] Do not throw error in db:decompress task if dump is already decompressed.
17) [TASK] Add new OptionUtility for managing "--options". Add new option "tags" that allow to set tags for dump filename.
18) [TASK] Refactor db:copy, db:pull, db:push. Store copies of dumps that will be imported and store dump of local database
    before import. This will allow to recover when database overwritten by accident. Add tags to dumps.
19) [TASK][BREAKING] Remove db:import:last task in favour of option for db:pull.
20) [TASK][BREAKING] Remove dependency to symfony/dotenv.
